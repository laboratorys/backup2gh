## backup-to-github
English | [中文](https://github.com/laboratorys/backup2gh/blob/main/README_CN.md)
### Features
1. A zero-cost solution for cloud containers where data is lost after a restart, especially for applications based on SQLite.
2. Applicable scenarios: Suitable for cases where real-time data updates are not critical and the dataset is relatively small.
3. Automatically backs up data to a GitHub repository on a schedule.
4. Restores the most recent backup when the container restarts.
5. Auto-creates a private backup repository if it doesn't exist. The backup repository includes a GitHub Action that periodically cleans up commit history to prevent excessive storage usage.

### Usage
1. Standalone
Create a config.yaml file in the same directory as backup2gh, with keys matching the environment variable names in lowercase:
```
bak_app_name: test
bak_data_dir: /app/data
bak_github_token: ***
bak_repo: backup-xxx
bak_repo_owner: owner
```
Run the following command
```
nohup ./backup2gh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

2. Using in a Dockerfile 
Example using Uptime Kuma in a Dockerfile:
```
FROM alpine AS builder
RUN apk add --no-cache nodejs npm git curl tar libc6-compat

RUN npm install npm -g

RUN adduser -D app
USER app
WORKDIR /home/app

RUN curl -L "https://github.com/laboratorys/backup2gh/releases/latest/download/backup2gh-linux-amd64.tar.gz" -o /tmp/backup2gh.tar.gz \
    && tar -xzf /tmp/backup2gh.tar.gz \
    && rm /tmp/backup2gh.tar.gz


RUN git clone https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma.git
WORKDIR /home/app/uptime-kuma
RUN npm run setup

EXPOSE 3001
CMD ["sh", "-c", "nohup /home/app/backup2gh & node server/server.js"]
```
### FAQ
1. Dependency issues on Alpine Linux:
 - To ensure backup2gh runs properly on an Alpine-based image, install the required dependencies:
   ```shell
   apk add --no-cache curl tar libc6-compat
   ```
 - Ubuntu-based images do not require libc6-compat.

2. Running the backup program at startup:
 - The backup program is executed before the main application using CMD.
 - You can also use ENTRYPOINT instead.
3. Multiple applications in a single repository:
 - If backing up multiple applications in the same repository, stagger the backup schedules to avoid SHA conflicts that may cause failures.
4. Backup frequency and retention:
 - In most cases, frequent backups are unnecessary.
 - Keeping too many backup files is also not recommended.
5. Security warning for Web UI:
 - The Web interface is intended for temporary or testing use only.
 - Do not use the default admin account in a production environment.
